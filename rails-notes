RAILS ROUTER
  -purpose is to recognize URLs then dispatch them to a controllers actions
  -possibly to a Rack application is needed
  -also can generate paths and URLs avoiding hard-coded strings into views(helpers)

  -Routers take in all requests, send them back and forth to get to the correct place in the code
  -Helps with the traffic control of app

  get '/teacher/:id', to: 'teachers#show', as: 'teacher'
  ^^ singular, straight forward way to create route, where to go & how to get there


RESOURCES
  -Resource is a singular presence to CRUD
  -Resources is a plural presence to handle incoming generic posts with CRUD and index
  -resource routings declares are the coming routes for a given resourceful controller
  -CRUD routes and all the necessary routes for application
  eg:
  1. resources :students
  2. rake routes
  3.  Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
    students GET    /students(.:format)          students#index
             POST   /students(.:format)          students#create
 new_student GET    /students/new(.:format)      students#new
edit_student GET    /students/:id/edit(.:format) students#edit
     student GET    /students/:id(.:format)      students#show
             PATCH  /students/:id(.:format)      students#update
             PUT    /students/:id(.:format)      students#update
             DELETE /students/:id(.:format)      students#destroy

  -can define multiple resources at the same time(either way will work)
    resources :students, :teachers, :schools
    resources :teachers
    resources :schools


PATH & URL HELPERS
  -mostly used in/defined with specific prefix with a path attribute tagged after it
  eg: same
  students_path
  /students

  edit_student_path('12')
  /students/12/edit
