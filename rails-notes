  -purpose is to recognize URLs then dispatch them to a controllers actions
  -possibly to a Rack application is needed
  -also can generate paths and URLs avoiding hard-coded strings into views(helpers)

  -Routers take in all requests, send them back and forth to get to the correct place in the code
  -Helps with the traffic control of app

  get '/teacher/:id', to: 'teachers#show', as: 'teacher'
  ^^ singular, straight forward way to create route, where to go & how to get there
