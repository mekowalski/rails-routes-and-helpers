RESTFUL ACTIONS
-This is good to know is a possibility when Rails seems to restrict or confine
-add more restful actions
-not confined to the 7 routes that is created by default
-add additional routes applying to collection or individual members of collection
eg:
  1.resources :schools do
      member do
        get 'preview'
      end
    end
  2. rake routes
  3.    Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                    Controller#Action
preview_school GET    /schools/:id/preview(.:format) schools#preview    *added preview route*
       schools GET    /schools(.:format)             schools#index      *below are the 7 routes*
               POST   /schools(.:format)             schools#create

-It directs to the correct controller with it's respective action
-it's routing, passing the params and giving it to the same controller of member parent

-Same but different format
resources :schools do
  get 'preview', on: :member
end
