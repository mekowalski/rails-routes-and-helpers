RESTFUL ACTIONS
-This is good to know is a possibility when Rails seems to restrict or confine
-add more restful actions
-not confined to the 7 routes that is created by default
-add additional routes applying to collection or individual members of collection
eg:
  1.resources :schools do
      member do
        get 'preview'
      end
    end
  2. rake routes
  3.    Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                    Controller#Action
preview_school GET    /schools/:id/preview(.:format) schools#preview    *added preview route*
       schools GET    /schools(.:format)             schools#index      *below are the 7 routes*
               POST   /schools(.:format)             schools#create

-It directs to the correct controller with it's respective action
-it's routing, passing the params and giving it to the same controller of member parent

-Same but different format
resources :schools do
  get 'preview', on: :member
end


ADD ROUTE TO COLLECTION
-Enable Rails to recognize paths such as the specified URI Pattern route added to collection
1.resources :schools do
    collection do
      get 'search'
    end
  end
2. rake routes
3.      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                 Controller#Action
search_schools GET    /schools/search(.:format)   schools#search    *added search route*
       schools GET    /schools(.:format)          schools#index     *below are the 7 routes*
               POST   /schools(.:format)          schools#create

-same just trimmed
resources :schools do
  get 'search', on: :collection
end


ANOTHER ADDITIONAL ROUTE
resources :schools do
  get 'preview', on: :new
end

-allows rails to recognize a path with a GET verb for the URI Pattern of specified route
-creates route helpers 
            Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                    Controller#Action
preview_new_school GET    /schools/new/preview(.:format) schools#preview
