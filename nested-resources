NESTED RESOURCES
  -when you have a belongs_to association
  -nested route should allow that relationship in the routing
  eg: Model
  School has_many Teachers, Teachers has_many Students etc
  /school/1/teachers/

  1.resources :schools do
      resources :teachers
    end
  2. rake routes
  3.  Prefix        Verb   URI Pattern                                     Controller#Action
    school_teachers GET    /schools/:school_id/teachers(.:format)          teachers#index
                    POST   /schools/:school_id/teachers(.:format)          teachers#create
 new_school_teacher GET    /schools/:school_id/teachers/new(.:format)      teachers#new
edit_school_teacher GET    /schools/:school_id/teachers/:id/edit(.:format) teachers#edit
     school_teacher GET    /schools/:school_id/teachers/:id(.:format)      teachers#show
                    PATCH  /schools/:school_id/teachers/:id(.:format)      teachers#update
                    PUT    /schools/:school_id/teachers/:id(.:format)      teachers#update
                    DELETE /schools/:school_id/teachers/:id(.:format)      teachers#destroy
            schools GET    /schools(.:format)                              schools#index
                    POST   /schools(.:format)                              schools#create
         new_school GET    /schools/new(.:format)                          schools#new
        edit_school GET    /schools/:id/edit(.:format)                     schools#edit
             school GET    /schools/:id(.:format)                          schools#show
                    PATCH  /schools/:id(.:format)                          schools#update
                    PUT    /schools/:id(.:format)                          schools#update
                    DELETE /schools/:id(.:format)                          schools#destroy

-Can nest resources as deep as you want, but it gets a little out of hand
-controllers#actions are still simple and nice though
-They become difficult to work with and cumbersome
eg:
    Prefix: edit_school_teacher_student
    Verb: GET
    URI Pattern: /schools/:school_id/teachers/:teacher_id/students/:id/edit(.:format)
    Controller#Action: students#edit


*RAILS WAY*
Resources should never be more than one level deep
